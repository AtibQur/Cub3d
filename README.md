<h2>Description Cub3D üïπÔ∏è</h2>
This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90's game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you'll have to find your way.

<br>
<pre>
git clone git@github.com:AtibQur/cub3d.git
cd cub3d
make
